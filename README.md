*Technical*
- Single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit to do list and always shows the stuffs right below the input form.

*Design/UX*
###### User-Testing 1
  * Tester last name: Zhu
He did find that my server does the order of to do list with specific order. He thought probably it would be better if I could make it ordering as somehow like alphabetic, ungency etc. Actually I did not change to exactly what he said. Instead, I organized them with classifier.

###### User-Testing 2
  * Tester last name: Zhang
She thought my overall color is great, and the design is what she likes. She thought it would be better to distinct clear and delete since I originally have clear stuff as delete button which did confuse users. Obviously I changed it :)

###### Styling and functionality
